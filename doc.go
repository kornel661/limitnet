/*
Package limitnet provides some network primitives, most notably throttled
listener, needed by my nserv (https://gopkg.in/kornel661/nserv.v0) package.

Usage:

	import "gopkg.in/kornel661/limitnet.v0"

or

	go get gopkg.in/kornel661/limitnet.v0

Replace v0 by the version you need (v0 is a development version, with no API
stability guaratees).

For up-to-date changelog and features list see [README]
(https://github.com/kornel661/limitnet/blob/master/README.md).
